# Task-trucker-moe
this is a simple application that was develeped using React.js and it was a simple project to enhance my understanding of different tools that the library is presenting 

# How it works
it is composed of two main section, the first one is the header where we the title of the app as well as the cta button that would be used to create or to add a specific task the second section is the form that is used to add the task by the user and last but not least the third and final section where we have a table of all tasks that has been added by the user 

# Optimization 
this application can be optimized by adding a backend layer (Express.js) to it where a DB (Mongoose) can be connected to it and a login form can be used also with the help of Passeport.js so that each user can log and the application becomes a full task trucker application
